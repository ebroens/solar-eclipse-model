Examples and Tutorials
======================

This section provides detailed examples and tutorials demonstrating the full workflow
of the Solar Eclipse Model, particularly focusing on the MCMC fitting
pipeline and its configuration.

Full MCMC Analysis Workflow with `model_eclipse_mcmc.py`
---------------------------------------------------------

The primary script for performing MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis
on solar eclipse light curves is `model_eclipse_mcmc.py`, located in the
root directory of the repository. This script reads configuration from a YAML file,
executes the MCMC sampling, and generates various output files including
fit summaries and plots.

**Running the Script:**

You should execute `model_eclipse_mcmc.py` from the root directory of the repository.
It accepts command-line arguments to specify the configuration file and
which model(s) to run.

.. code-block:: bash

    # To run a specific model (e.g., the 'linear' limb darkening model)
    # Ensure you are in the project root directory (e.g., ~/SolarEclipsModel/with_gemini_docs/)
    python model_eclipse_mcmc.py --config config/config.yaml --model linear

    # To run all models defined in the config.yaml
    python model_eclipse_mcmc.py --config config/config.yaml --model all


**Configuration (`config.yaml`):**

The `config.yaml` file is central to controlling the behavior of the
`model_eclipse_mcmc.py` script. It defines data paths, MCMC fitting
parameters, and plotting configurations. This file is located in the
`config/` directory.

It is divided into two main sections: `common` and `models`.

* **`common`**: Global settings that apply across all model runs.

    * `output_dir` (string): Directory where all results (MCMC chains, plots, fit summaries) will be saved.
    * `data_file` (string): File containing observational measurements. This file is expected to be space-delimited with comments starting with `#`.
    * `date_column` (string): The header name of the column in `data_file` that contains the date component of the observations.
    * `time_column` (string): The header name of the column in `data_file` that contains the time component of the observations.
    * `flux_column` (string): The header name of the column in `data_file` that contains the (normalized) flux to be modeled.
    * `color_channel` (string): A single character (e.g., 'G' for green) used in filenames and plot labels to denote the color channel of the observations.
    * `sigma_data` (float): The estimated accuracy (standard deviation) of the measured flux data.
    * `plot_config` (dictionary): Configuration settings specifically for generating plots.
        * `plot_color` (string): Matplotlib color string for the main data plot (e.g., 'green', 'k').
        * `plot_marker_symbol` (string): Matplotlib marker symbol for the main data plot (e.g., '.', 'o').
        * `plot_range` (dictionary): Dictionary of the plotting time range (start_datetime, end_datetime) in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format.
        * `eclipse_times` (dictionary): Dictionary of eclipse contact times (tc1, tc2, tc3, tc4) in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format. These are used for plotting shaded regions on the light curve. `tc2` and `tc3` can be removed or commented out for partial eclipses.
        * `inset` (dictionary): Configuration for an inset plot within the main light curve plot.
            * `enabled` (boolean): `true` to enable the inset, `false` to disable.
            * `loc` (string): Location of the inset ('lower left', 'upper right', etc.).
            * `width` (string): Width of the inset (e.g., "80%").
            * `height` (string): Height of the inset (e.g., "80%").
            * `bbox_to_anchor` (list of floats): Bounding box for the inset axes (x, y, width, height) in normalized coordinates.
            * `bbox_transform` (string): Transformation for `bbox_to_anchor` ('axes', 'figure', 'data').
            * `x_lim` (list of strings): X-axis limits for the inset plot (e.g., ["2019-07-02 20:35:00", "2019-07-02 20:45:00"]).
            * `y_lim` (list of floats): Y-axis limits for the inset plot (e.g., [-0.02, 0.05]).
            * `mark_inset_loc` (list of ints): Corners to use for connecting the inset axes and the area in the parent axes (e.g., [1, 3]).

* **`models`**: Definitions for different eclipse models, each with its own specific parameters and fitting configuration. Each key under `models` (e.g., `linear`, `quadratic`, `uniform`) represents a distinct model variant.

    For each model (e.g., `linear`, `quadratic`, `uniform`):

    * `limb_dark` (string): The limb darkening law to use ('linear', 'quadratic', 'uniform').
    * `moon_radius` (float): The radius of the Moon in units of the Sun's radius.
    * `atm_ext` (float): The atmospheric extinction coefficient.
    * `u` (list of floats): Limb darkening coefficients. The number of elements depends on the `limb_dark` law (e.g., `[u1]` for linear, `[u1, u2]` for quadratic, `[]` for uniform).
    * `lat` (float): Latitude of the observer in degrees.
    * `lon` (float): Longitude of the observer in degrees.
    * `fit_params` (dictionary): Parameters to be fitted by the MCMC sampler, along with their priors and plotting labels. Each entry in `fit_params` is a parameter name (e.g., `u1`, `u2`, `atm_ext`, `moon_radius`, `log_sigma_jitter`).
        * `prior` (list of floats): The lower and upper bounds for the uniform prior distribution of the parameter. For `log_sigma_jitter`, these values will be converted to log scale internally.
        * `plot_label` (string): The LaTeX-formatted label to use for this parameter in plots (e.g., corner plots). Use `{{color_channel}}` as a placeholder for the `color_channel` defined in the `common` section.
    * `plotting` (dictionary): Model-specific plotting configurations for the `plot_data_and_model` function.
        * `color` (string): Matplotlib color string for this model's light curve line (e.g., 'k', 'green').
        * `line_style` (string): Matplotlib line style for this model's light curve line (e.g., '-', '--').
        * `residuals_marker` (string): Matplotlib marker symbol for this model's residuals (e.g., '.', '+').
        * `model_label` (string): Label for this model to appear in the plot legend.


**Output and Results:**

When `model_eclipse_mcmc.py` is executed, it generates various output files in the directory specified by `output_dir` in your `config.yaml` (defaulting to `./results/`).

These outputs typically include:

* **MCMC Fit Summary CSVs:** Files like `mcmc_fit_results_linear_G_YYYYMMDD.csv` providing statistical summaries (median, 1-sigma credible intervals) for the fitted parameters.
* **Corner Plots:** PNG images (e.g., `corner_plot_linear_G_YYYYMMDD.png`) visualizing the marginalized posterior distributions of the fitted parameters.
* **Data-Model Comparison Plots:** PNG images (e.g., `model_fit_G_YYYYMMDD.png`) showing the observed data, the best-fit model light curve, and the residuals.
* **Sampler State (Optional):** Pickled sampler objects (`sampler_MODELNAME.pkl`) if `save_data` is enabled in `run_sampler`.

To illustrate, here is an example plot generated by a typical run of the `uniform LD, linear LD and linear LD with the moon to sun ratio fixed models` on observations of the total solar eclipse of 2019 in Chile. This plot shows the normalized observed flux alongside the best-fit model light curve,
including residuals in the lower panel. The shaded regions indicate the partial and total eclipse phases. Notice how the model accurately captures the light curve morphology during the eclipse. 
At first sight the light curve looks strange, with an ascending branch that does not reach the full brightness again. This is caused by the atmospheric extinction. The sun was only 1* above the horizon at 4th contact and hence appeared much fainter than at first contact which occured at an altitude of 25Â°.

The next plot is a corner plot for fitted parameters (e.g., limb darkening coefficient, atmospheric extinction, 
and moon radius) for the `linear LD` model. The histograms on the diagonals show the 1D posteriors,
and the scatter plots show the 2D correlations between parameters. The vertical
lines indicate the median and 1-sigma credible intervals which still underestimate the true errors.
